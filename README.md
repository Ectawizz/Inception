# Inception

Welcome to this beautiful place where your worst nightmare begin: **Inception**.
First time with Docker ?
Good luck.

To make things easier, you can use the guide depending of your main language.
The goal of this repo is to have a guide for the most language possible so if you speak a language that hasn't a guide for it, you can contact me to kellianbarbry@gmail.com for sending me a translation, it would be amazing.

If you spot any mistakes (like with my terrible english), or misexplained things in any guide, feel free to contact me too.

That's the only 2 things I'm asking to any one who want to use those guides.

Thanks a lot !
